Chinese economy develops very fast in last few decades and a lot of people get rich. 
In foreigners’ eyes, Chinese people are everywhere. 
Indeed, traveling is one of the hottest plans for Chinese people. 
But compared to most foreigners, our manner is always criticized. 
The most obvious problem is talking loudly in the public occasion. 
Because we get used to be a group and haven’t realized our voice disturb others. 
So it is in need of changing this bad habit. 
What’s more, many people jump the queue, which is really rude.Only when we admit our impolite acts will we do better in the future. 
The moment that I went to middle school, I changed a lot. 
Firstly, I realized that I was not a little girl anymore, I had grown up and should be independent. 
So I tried to solve the problem by myself. 
If I figure out many ways and can’t fix it, then I will turn to my parents for advice. 
Secondly, I become responsible for myself. 
My mother supervised me to do the homework before, now I can finish it without anyone’s reminding, because I know the importance of getting improve. 
My parents are so happy about my changes, and they no longer treat me as a little kid. 
People always say that youth is the basis to do a lot of things. 
Indeed, young people can do what they want and try to do some crazy things to leave good memories. 
As for me, I have done the crazy thing and I felt so awesome. 
It was my friend who asked me to join the flash mobs.
 At first, I felt so crazy and couldn’t believe such activity would around me. 
 But I said yes at last because I wanted to try something new. 
 We practised in the group, then after a week, we danced in the central square. 
 It was such a good experience for me, and the memory will last forever.
